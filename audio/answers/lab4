1. I haven't gotten it to compile yet with a dynamic pitch factor.
2. The critical path is in the FIR filter (without the dynamic pitch factor,
   obviously, because I haven't gotten that to compile yet).
3. Once it compiled and passed the timing constraints,
   the FPGA worked on the first try.
4. Subinterfaces allow you to do something like reverse inheritence.
   You can combine interfaces into larger wholes.
5. We could pipeline the FFT in the perpendicular direction.
   Make each stage a circular pipeline that processes the chunks of the sample.
   The rest of the audio pipeline wouldn't need to change, if the other parts could
   handle the increased width on their own.
