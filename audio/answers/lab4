1. Number of Slice Registers:                29,802 out of  69,120   43%
   Number of Slice LUTs:                     50,448 out of  69,120   72%
   I was unable to get values for individual modules, because adding the
   synthesize boundaries reduced performance unacceptably.
2. Length of critical path: 19.477ns
3. Once it compiled and passed the timing constraints,
   the FPGA worked on the first try.
4. Subinterfaces allow you to do something like reverse inheritence.
   You can combine interfaces into larger wholes.
5. We could pipeline the FFT in the perpendicular direction.
   Make each stage a circular pipeline that processes the chunks of the sample.
   The rest of the audio pipeline wouldn't need to change, if the other parts could
   handle the increased width on their own.
