2. All the non-scoreboard FIFOs are of whatever the default size is (I've heard 2).
   I chose this because it doesn't seem to be terribly important. Increasing it might
   increase IPS somewhat, but I didn't have time to investigate this.

   The scoreboard is of size 8. I picked it because it was big enough. Making it smaller
   might be better. I haven't investigated this due to lack of time.
   I used a pipeline scoreboard, so that instructions are released as soon as the data
   hazard is resolved, and not one cycle later.

   I used a bypass register file. It increased IPC dramatically relative to non-bypassed,
   but did not decrease the maximum frequency much.
   
   The logical order of the pipeline stages is:

     doFetchReq
     doFetchResp
     doDecode
     doWriteBack
     doRegFetch
     doExecute

3. IPS with bypassed (multiply benchmark)        0.69 IPC * 113 MHz = 78 MIPS
   IPS with non-bypassed (multiply benchmark)    0.41 IPC * 123 MHz = 50 MIPS

   Bypassing improves real performance dramatically, because IPC goes way up.
